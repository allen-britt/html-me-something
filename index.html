            <p>
                Digital art is something that really takes time, dedication, and of course skill<br>

                I am not really talented when it comes to digital artwork, yet I am facinated by it.<br>
                I hope to one day compile my own pieces of art admired by the masses.<br>
                <br>

            <p>
                This image is one that I have altered to some degree<br><br>
                Before:<br><br>
                <img src="images/wolf head pre edit.jpg"><br><br>
                After:<br><br>
                <img src="images/Wolf Custom.jpg"><br><br>
                Here is another example of the same alteration with a little less aggression:<br><br>
                <img src="images/First run.jpg">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                This effect is acomplished with overlays and the use of built in screen.<br>
                The hard part is finding images that would blend well.<br>

                <p>If you are interest in how I was able to make these images with the overlays,<br>
                I learned how to make both of these images from the following video:<br></p>
